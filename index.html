      <p>Its a well known fact that the mrt3 has not been in a good position since 2015.<br />
         It has consistently exceded the allowable capacity throughout the year. The goverment needs <br />
         to atleast manage a capacity of 400,000 to 500,000 people daily. The interactive visualizations <br />
         below show's the state of the MRT and its daily operations. Mrt issues also seems to appear so <br />
         frequently throughout the past year, showing a possible lack of maintenance going through the MRT. <br />

      <p>All D3 code is done by myself, here is post on my <a href="https://ryanliwag.github.io/Visualizing-MRT-2017/">website</a> discussing my journey through building these visualizations. <br />
         All data is given by efoi philippines, additional data such as mrt problems and weather is scraped by myself from MRT website and Pagasa. <br />
